Range, Variance, Standard Deviation

xi – mean, (xi – mean)² computed for understanding distribution

Salary category classification using nested IF formulas

✔ Logical & Aggregate Excel Functions

COUNT / COUNTIF / COUNTIFS for demographic counts

Clean visual layout with professional chart design

Automated updating when data changes

This dashboard transforms raw numbers into an easy-to-understand narrative.

🔍 Key Insights Derived

📈 Salary increases with experience, indicating a positive correlation.

👥 Gender-based salary differences exist but depend on experience distribution.

🧮 Most employees fall under the Low salary category, showing skewness in salary distribution.

🎯 High variation in salary values suggests varying job roles and levels.

🧑‍💼 Younger employees dominate the dataset, with a low average experience level.
